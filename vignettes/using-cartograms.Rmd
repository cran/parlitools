# Scaling with `cartogram`

You can use the [`cartogram`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cartogram) package with `parlitools` to produce maps with scaled areas, as seen in [Xinye Li's post on Brexit votes](https://xinye1.github.io/projects/brexit-cartogram-leaflet/). 

As the cartogram package requires SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects, instead of simple features objects, the 'west_hex_map' object is converted first to a Spatial object, and then to a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame object, as there is no function to convert directly from sf to SpatialPolygonsDataFrame.

The map below shows the relative safety of each parliamentary seat, as represented by the percentage point margin between each seat's winning and second place candidate---the 'majority'---in the 2015 General Election. The larger the seat's hexagon, the safer---in theory---it is.

It uses datasets included in this package, namely the British Election Study ('bes_2015'), 'party_colours' and 'west_hex_map'. As the BES only covers Wales, Scotland and England, Northern Ireland is not included in the map.

# Creating map labels
labels <- paste0(

    opacity = 0.5,
    fillOpacity = 1,
    fillColor = ~party_colour,
    label=labels)
