# Variable names in `census_11` 

Due to the 191 variables included in the `census_11` dataset, including information on each variable in the `parlitools` reference manual is very lengthy and not very user friendly. This vignette reproduces the table including with the British Election Study data, available [here](http://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-object/2017-bes-constituency-results-with-census-and-candidate-data/). The 'Name' column refers to the variable name used in the `bes_2015` dataset, the 'Data Type' column refers to the R data type, and the 'Census Table' column refers to the location in the 2011 Census that demographic data was retrieved from.
